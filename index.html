    <h1>Project: Website Redesign for the Faculty of Art and Design Education</h1>
    <h2>Client: Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia (UPI) | 2025</h2>

    <p>
      This project involved a comprehensive redesign of the official website for UPI's Faculty of Art and Design Education (FPSD). The primary objectives were to modernize the user interface, streamline navigation, and enhance the user experience for students, faculty, and prospective applicants.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Note: The final design was successfully completed and presented; however, it was not published due to pre-existing technical constraints within the university's mandated Content Management System (CMS), which could not accommodate the new design framework.
